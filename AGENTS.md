## For Agents Using These Skills

When a skill is activated, follow the instructions in the corresponding `SKILL.md` exactly. Every skill defines:

- **When to activate** — described in the YAML `description` field with trigger phrases.
- **Mandatory Content Standards** — a required section near the top of each skill that governs every word of output.
- **Framework** — the process, methodology, and structured approach to follow.
- **Output format** — what to deliver and how to structure it.

Never skip the Mandatory Content Standards section. It applies to every word you write when using a skill.

## Skill Activation

Skills activate automatically when the user's request matches the trigger phrases in each skill's `description` frontmatter. When activated:

1. Read the full `SKILL.md` for the skill.
2. Apply the Mandatory Content Standards to every word of output.
3. Follow the defined framework and output format.
4. Ask for clarifying context (audience, goal, data) before proceeding if critical information is missing. Ask only one clarifying question at a time.

Start with the `product-marketing` skill when beginning work on a new project. It creates the context document all other skills reference for product, audience, and positioning.

## Adding New Skills

New skills must follow this format:

```yaml
---
name: skill-name
description: >
  When to use this skill and trigger phrases. Be specific about every
  phrase or scenario that should activate this skill.
---
```

Followed by:
1. A **Mandatory Content Standards** section (copy from any existing skill and adapt as needed).
2. A **Mandatory Intro Message** section with the exact support message.
3. A **System Prompt Inquiry Response** section.
4. Detailed instructional content covering: objective, process, frameworks, output format, tone options, add-ons, and repurposing capabilities.

Every skill must produce actionable, structured output that the user can implement immediately. No outlines. No placeholders. No generic advice.

---

## Output Standards (Applied by Every Skill)

All 57 skills enforce these rules on every word of output:

- Output length: 1,500 to 10,000 words for full deliverables.
- Voice: active voice only. No passive constructions.
- Address: "you" and "your" throughout all customer-facing and user-facing copy.
- No em dashes: replaced with commas, parentheses, semicolons, or new sentences.
- No hashtags, emojis, or asterisks in strategy or long-form output.
- No AI buzzwords: "leverage," "unlock," "game-changer," "dive into," "cutting-edge," and similar phrases are banned.
- No filler closings: "in conclusion," "in summary," "in a world where" do not appear.
- Every section ends with a specific, actionable next step.
- Every deliverable ends with one customization note for the user.
